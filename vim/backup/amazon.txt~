Amazon: Thank you for waiting.
As I have checked and found that your order status is showing Pending Fulfillment that's why it is not progressing.In this case I have to retyr your payment card.Please give me your last 4 digit number and expiry date of your payment card.
Me: My payment methods are on my account. I haven't had any problems with other purchases. Why has payment not been taken?
Amazon: I understand your concern.Sometimes it happens that the system will take time to authorize your payment.If I will retry your card right now then your payment will be confirmed and your order will progress normally.
If you wish i will retry your payment card right now.
Me: I had checked the order and payment method, elected retry card ... it didn't give me any changes. Is this the same effect?
Amazon: Please give me your details I will try it from my end.
Me: 3120 & 06/16

Just check your order status.It is showing that your payment is confirmed.
